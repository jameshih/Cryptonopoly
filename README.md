<h1>Cryptonopoly</h1>
<h4>Multiplayer Cryptocurrency Game<h4>


<h2 style="text-align:center;">Abstract</h2>

<p>Cryptonopoly is a four players board game based on the theme of cryptocurrency. The concept of Cryptonopoly is inspired by the famous board game, Monopoly, which I borrowed a lot of concepts and game rules to create this game. My intention of creating Cryptonopoly is to provide an easy and fun way for the general public to feel how is it like to participant in the current state of the crypto-economy without putting real money into buying cryptocurrencies yet. </p>

Cryptonopoly has three different cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and a fictional cryptocurrency called Token. Players will be buying and trading Bitcoin and Ethereum, which some of the items in the game are valued based on the price of these two coins. Token is a coin that players can mine in the game. One will receive Tokens each around based on how many miners and miner lifetimes he or she has.

dApp cards are the property cards in Cryptonopoly, similar to the housing property card in Monopoly. dApp cards are valued based on Ethereum's price, which players can buy with Ethereum when landed on an unclaimed dApp. Player will have to draw two question cards and answer correctly to one of the question before being granted to purchase the dApp. After purchasing a dApp, player can upgrade when landing on the dApp again. Player will also have to draw two question cards and answer correctly to one before being granted to upgrade the dApp. Each dApp can be upgraded two times only. Others will have to pay Ethereum when landing on someone else's dApp. If the dApp is level two or above, players can draw one question card and answer correctly to only pay the base value of the dApp. The concept of dApp is based on the dApps, decentralized Applications, on the Ethereum network that blockchain developers' develop in the real world.

<h3>Miner</h3>

<br><br>
A Miner is a mining machine that mines Token in Cryptonopoly, which players can purchase at the beginning of the game or each time after passing Go as the last move. Each miner costs 200 Dollars and each of them has three lives, each time the player passes Go, the player has to pay 50 dollars electricity fee for each miner and the miners will all decrease by one life. If a miner runs out of life it is useless. Players can receive Token rewards based on how may miner lives each of his or her miners have.
<br><br>
Here is a simple form to calculate the Token rewards based on miner lives:
<br><br>
Three Lives = 100 Tokens
<br>
Two Lives = 50 Tokens
<br>
One Live = 25 Tokens
