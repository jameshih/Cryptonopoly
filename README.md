<h4>Multiplayer Cryptocurrency Game<h4>


<h2 style="text-align:center;">Abstract</h2>

<p>Cryptonopoly is a four players board game based on the theme of cryptocurrency. The concept of Cryptonopoly is inspired by the famous board game, Monopoly, which I borrowed a lot of concepts and game rules to create this game. My intention of creating Cryptonopoly is to provide an easy and fun way for the general public to feel how is it like to participant in the current state of the crypto-economy without putting real money into buying cryptocurrencies yet. </p>

<p>The game board of Cryptonopoly is similar to Monopoly's game board. Players start on Go and take turns to roll dices and move around the board. Each player has to perform action according to the spot that he or she lands on.</p>

Cryptonopoly has three different cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and a fictional cryptocurrency called Token. Players will be buying and trading Bitcoin and Ethereum, which some of the items in the game are valued based on the price of these two coins. Token is a coin that players can mine in the game. One will receive Tokens each around based on how many miners and miner lifetimes he or she has.
